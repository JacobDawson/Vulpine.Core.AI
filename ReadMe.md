# Vulpine Core Library: Artificial Intelligence

http://www.jakesden.com/corelibrary.html

The Vulpine Core Library is a collection of software libraries (assemblies) written in the C# programing language. It is my personal repository of code, in that I am the sole developer. However, I have opened it up to the public, under the Apache License 2.0, with the hope that it would be of some benefit. It serves as the backbone of most of my homegrown video games and applications. The fractals and other computer generated art I have on display were created using the code from this library.

The library itself is continuously evolving, as I am constantly adding to it, updating it whenever I find something that tickles my fancy. I have big plans for stuff that I want to include in the library, and it is far from completion. I doubt it will ever be complete. Due to the dynamic nature of the library, I cannot guarantee backwards compatibility, so expect to have to re-factor your code if you use any of my APIs. Of course you are free to rewrite my code in your own style, whatever fits your needs.

This sub-library involves artificial intelligence, neural networks, machine learning, and genetic algorithms. It contains various algorithms to train an evolve different types of neural networks, for use in classification problems, strategic game-play, and computer generated art, among others. It also features more classical approaches to artificial intelligence. It is meant to be a comprehensive, though not exhaustive, collection of problem solving methods.

All documentation for the library is included in the code itself. Every public method and class is heavily commented, providing intellisense for things like parameter use and expected output. I hope it is clear-cut what each method dose, and its intended use, from the documentation I have provided. If not, at least I tried my best. I hope that you will find my code useful, and intuitive, and perhaps maybe even learn something from it.
